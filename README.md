# Import and wrangling of Texas Academic Performance Reports (TAPR) data for the 2016 - 2017 school year

This R code focuses on the import and wrangling of 2016-2017 TAPR data, with a specific focus on the _all student_, _english language learner (ELL)_, and _economically disadvantaged (low SES)_ sub-groups. The data was pulled from several sources. 

The [campus-level TAPR data download](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2017/download/DownloadData.html) was used to obtain the following datasets:
- Reference Information, Accountability Rating and Special Education Determination Status **(CREF.csv)** 
- STAAR Approaches Grade Level or Above (Grades 3 to 8), Approaches Grade Level or Above (End of Course) **(CAMPSTAAR1.csv)**
- STAAR Approaches Grade Level or Above (All Grades), Meets Grade Level, Masters Grade Level **(CAMPSTAAR2.csv)**

Student mobility data was pulled from the [preliminary TAPR dataset](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/cgi/sas/broker) **(CSTUD.csv)**
